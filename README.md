test repository for in-class assignment 1

This README contains the instructions for completing your first individual assignment using git inside the Systems Programming S19 class.

##Instructions:
1. You'll clone this repository to your machine. When cloning, choose a folder structure like this: <some_base_dir>/cs3410/lectures/lecture1/
2. Inside the cloned directory, you'll create a myFile.md file using a text editor (note that the extension is ".md". If you can't do it, make a myFile.txt file).
3. Inside the myFile.md file, you'll add the following information: a. your name b. your favorite movie
4. Once you are done, you'll do one of the following 2 things: a. you'll use git in your terminal to add the file to your local repo and then you'll commit the changes and push it into the remote repository. b. you'll use the "Upload File" option in the GitHub interface and add the file "myFile.md" to your remote repo directly.
5. You dance a little jig.
